# Test to Speech



In this mini project we made GUI software, known as “TEXT TO SPEECH”. Current state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems produce intelligible speech but lack the prosody of natural utterances. In recent years, the most popular acoustic model in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) is a hidden Markov model (HMM), due to its ease of implementation and modelling flexibility.

Project TTS(text to speech) is developed using the python programming language, since the python is easy to implement and have a lot of predefined modules for web and desktop app development, we uses the “pyttsx3” module.

In this project we worked upon python text to speech module pyttsx3 version 3, pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. An application invokes the pyttsx3.init() factory function to get a reference to a pyttsx3. Engine instance. it is a very easy to use tool which converts the entered text into speech.
	
TTS project is a gui program, in which we uses TKINTER module is used for designing graphical user interface. The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems. When we think about GUI then we think about modern look to our project, so in this project we uses FIGMA to create modern GUI to look better. Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that’s taking the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch, which runs as a standalone MacOS app, Figma is entirely browser-based, and therefore works not only on Macs, but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks.

Already, digital voice interactions are driving the growth of new digital spaces like the metaverse and augmented reality. But good business decisions don’t just follow tech trends. New investments must pay off with benefits that drive quick returns. Text to speech does. To show how, here are just 10 of the dozens of TTS benefits, covering everything from brand affinity to corporate learning.
